# Fruit Tree
### Step Two: Implement the `FruitTree` class

#### Instance variables

| Attribute         | Data Type | Get | Set | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | --------- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| typeOfFruit       | String    | X   |     | The type of fruit on the tree.                    |
| piecesOfFruitLeft | int       | X   |     | The number of remaining fruit pieces on the tree. |

#### Constructor

Create a constructor for this class that accepts two parameters: `String typeOfFruit` and `int startingPiecesOfFruit`. Use these parameters to set the instance variables of the class.

#### Methods

Create a method called `pickFruit` that accepts an `int` called `numberOfPiecesToRemove` and returns a `boolean`.
- If there are enough pieces left on the tree, it "picks" the fruit and updates `piecesOfFruitLeft` by subtracting `numberOfPiecesToRemove` from it.
- The method returns `true` if there were enough pieces left to pick. It returns `false` if no fruit was pickedâ€”that is, `piecesOfFruitLeft` was less than `numberOfPiecesToRemove`.
